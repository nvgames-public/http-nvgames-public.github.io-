    Service.
    Users who are uncertain about which Personal Data is mandatory are welcome to contact the Owner.
    Any use of Cookies – or of other tracking tools – by this Application or by the owners of third-party services used
    by this Application serves the purpose of providing the Service required by the User, in addition to any other
    purposes described in the present document and in the Cookie Policy, if available.

    Users are responsible for any third-party Personal Data obtained, published or shared through this Application and
    confirm that they have the third party's consent to provide the Data to the Owner.

    <h2>Mode and place of processing the Data</h2>
    <h3>Methods of processing</h3>
    The Owner takes appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized access, disclosure, modification, or
    unauthorized destruction of the Data.
    The Data processing is carried out using computers and/or IT enabled tools, following organizational procedures and
    modes strictly related to the purposes indicated. In addition to the Owner, in some cases, the Data may be
    accessible to certain types of persons in charge,
    involved with the operation of this Application (administration, sales, marketing, legal, system administration) or
    external parties (such as third-party technical service providers, mail carriers, hosting providers, IT companies,
    communications agencies) appointed, if necessary, as Data Processors by the Owner.
    The updated list of these parties may be requested from the Owner at any time.

    <h3>Legal basis of processing</h3>
    The Owner may process Personal Data relating to Users if one of the following applies:

    Users have given their consent for one or more specific purposes. Note: Under some legislations the Owner may be
    allowed to process Personal Data until the User objects to such processing (“opt-out”), without having to rely on
    consent or any other of the following legal bases. This, however, does not apply,
    whenever the processing of Personal Data is subject to European data protection law;
    provision of Data is necessary for the performance of an agreement with the User and/or for any pre-contractual
    obligations thereof;
    processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the Owner is subject;
    processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority
    vested in the Owner;
    processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the Owner or by a third party.
    In any case, the Owner will gladly help to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the processing, and in
    particular whether the provision of Personal Data is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement
    necessary to enter into a contract.

    <h3>Place</h3>
    The Data is processed at the Owner's operating offices and in any other places where the parties involved in the
    processing are located.

    Depending on the User's location, data transfers may involve transferring the User's Data to a country other than
    their own. To find out more about the place of processing of such transferred Data, Users can check the section
    containing details about the processing of Personal Data.

    Users are also entitled to learn about the legal basis of Data transfers to a country outside the European Union or
    to any international organization governed by public international law or set up by two or more countries, such as
    the UN, and about the security measures taken by the Owner to safeguard their Data.

    If any such transfer takes place, Users can find out more by checking the relevant sections of this document or
    inquire with the Owner using the information provided in the contact section.

    <h3>Retention time</h3>
    Personal Data shall be processed and stored for as long as required by the purpose they have been collected for.

    Therefore:

    Personal Data collected for purposes related to the performance of a contract between the Owner and the User shall
    be retained until such contract has been fully performed.
    Personal Data collected for the purposes of the Owner’s legitimate interests shall be retained as long as needed to
    fulfill such purposes. Users may find specific information regarding the legitimate interests pursued by the Owner
    within the relevant sections of this document or by contacting the Owner.
    The Owner may be allowed to retain Personal Data for a longer period whenever the User has given consent to such
    processing, as long as such consent is not withdrawn. Furthermore, the Owner may be obliged to retain Personal Data
    for a longer period whenever required to do so for the performance of a
    legal obligation or upon order of an authority.

    Once the retention period expires, Personal Data shall be deleted. Therefore, the right to access, the right to
    erasure, the right to rectification and the right to data portability cannot be enforced after expiration of the
    retention period.

    <h2>The purposes of processing</h2>

    <h4>The right to know and to portability</h4>
    
    You have the right to request that we disclose to you:
    
    the categories and sources of the personal information that we collect about you, the purposes for which we use your
    information and with whom such information is shared;
    in case of sale of personal information or disclosure for a business purpose, two separate lists where we disclose:
    for sales, the personal information categories purchased by each category of recipient; and
    for disclosures for a business purpose, the personal information categories obtained by each category of recipient.
    
    The disclosure described above will be limited to the personal information collected or used over the past 12 months.
    
    If we deliver our response electronically, the information enclosed will be "portable", i.e. delivered in an easily
    usable format to enable you to transmit the information to another entity without hindrance – provided that this is
    technically feasible.
    
    <h4>The right to request the deletion of your personal information</h4>
    
    You have the right to request that we delete any of your personal information, subject to exceptions set forth by the
    law (such as, including but not limited to, where the information is used to identify and repair errors on this
    Application, to detect security incidents and protect against fraudulent or illegal activities, to exercise certain
    rights etc.).
    
    If no legal exception applies, as a result of exercising your right, we will delete your personal information and direct
    any of our service providers to do so.
    
    <h4>How to exercise your rights</h4>
    
    To exercise the rights described above, you need to submit your verifiable request to us by contacting us via the
    details provided in this document.
    
    For us to respond to your request, it’s necessary that we know who you are. Therefore, you can only exercise the above
    rights by making a verifiable request which must:
    
    provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal
    information or an authorized representative;
    describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
    
    We will not respond to any request if we are unable to verify your identity and therefore confirm the personal
    information in our possession actually relates to you.
    
    If you cannot personally submit a verifiable request, you can authorize a person registered with the California
    Secretary of State to act on your behalf.
    
    If you are an adult, you can make a verifiable request on behalf of a minor under your parental authority.
    
    You can submit a maximum number of 2 requests over a period of 12 months.
    
    <h4>How and when we are expected to handle your request</h4>
    
    We will confirm receipt of your verifiable request within 10 days and provide information about how we will process your
    request.
    
    We will respond to your request within 45 days of its receipt. Should we need more time, we will explain to you the
    reasons why, and how much more time we need. In this regard, please note that we may take up to 90 days to fulfill your
    request.
    
    Our disclosure(s) will cover the preceding 12 month period.
    
    Should we deny your request, we will explain you the reasons behind our denial.
    
    We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable request unless such request is manifestly unfounded or
    excessive. In such cases, we may charge a reasonable fee, or refuse to act on the request. In either case, we will
    communicate our choices and explain the reasons behind it.
